Envoys from (almost) all over Europe took this as an opportunity to go to Lower Bavaria as well. They made the Reichstag a place of European politics. This event has left a great deal of written documentation which are edited and published in the project The Imperial Diet of Regensburg, 1576 -- digital.",
